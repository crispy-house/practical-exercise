# Data Analytics Playground

A space to explore datasets, practice analytics, and tell clear data stories. The aim is to have fun with analysis and turn the best work into a professional portfolio.

## Goals
- Explore varied datasets and questions (sports, consumer trends, health, weather).
- Create concise, visual stories that highlight actionable insights.
- Keep everything reproducible and updated frequently with a goal to have clean notebooks and lightweight scripts.
- Grow a portfolio that shows analytical range and real impact.
